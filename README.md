<h1>Applied statistics for machine learning with Python</h1>

<p>This repository contains implementations of basic statistical models for machine learning in Python (version 3.6+). Each statistic model is implemented in a different ipynb file (using jupyter notebook to run). Aside from the implementation, there is an explanation on how to use the model and on when the model is used.</p>
